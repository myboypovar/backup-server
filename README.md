Cross-Platform Backup SystemOverviewThe Cross-Platform Backup System is a secure file transfer application that enables encrypted data transfer and storage between a Python-based server and a C++ client. It ensures data integrity and cross-platform compatibility while providing efficient user and file management.
FeaturesSecure File Transfer: Implements end-to-end encryption for safe data transfer.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Seamlessly integrates Python (server) and C++ (client) for broad usability.
Encrypted Data Storage: Ensures that stored files remain protected using encryption techniques.
User and File Management: Maintains a structured database for users and file tracking.
Version Control: Tracks file versions for better backup management.
Data Integrity: Validates and preserves data accuracy throughout the transfer process.
Technology StackServer: Python
Client: C++
Database: (Specify database used, e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
Encryption: (Specify encryption method, e.g., AES, RSA, etc.)
InstallationPrerequisitesPython 3.x
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
Database setup (if applicable)
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Setup InstructionsClone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cross-platform-backup.git
cd cross-platform-backupInstall server dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txtCompile the C++ client:
g++ -o client client.cpp -lcrypto -lsslSet up the database (if applicable).
Start the server:
python server.pyRun the client:
./clientUsageStart the server and connect the client to initiate file transfer.
Use authentication for secure access.
Transfer and retrieve files with encryption.
Track file versions for backup management.
Future ImprovementsImplement a GUI for easier user interaction.
Add support for additional encryption methods.
Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities.
